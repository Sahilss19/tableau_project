Washington House Sales Dashboard
Project Overview
This project is a Tableau dashboard visualizing house sales data for the state of Washington. It provides insights into various factors such as price distributions, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, house conditions, and geographical sales trends. The dashboard is interactive, enabling users to filter data based on different criteria like date, year built, lot size, and living area.
